## Content Overview

### [`SQL_COMMANDS-1.md`](SQL_COMMANDS-1.md)
**Data Definition Language (DDL)**
- Database creation and management
- Table constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, DEFAULT, CHECK, FOREIGN KEY)
- AUTO_INCREMENT functionality
- Parent-child table relationships
- DELETE and UPDATE operations with various constraints

### [`SQL_COMMANDS-2.md`](SQL_COMMANDS-2.md)
**Data Manipulation and Queries**
- Basic DML operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT)
- Table modification commands
- DISTINCT command usage
- Operators (Arithmetic, Logical, Bitwise, Pattern Matching)
- SQL clauses (WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING)
- Aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX, GROUP_CONCAT)
- Practice questions and examples

### [`SQL_COMMANDS-3.md`](SQL_COMMANDS-3.md)
**Advanced Queries and Operations**
- Comprehensive JOIN operations:
  - INNER JOIN
  - OUTER JOINS (LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
  - CROSS JOIN
  - EXCLUSIVE JOINS
  - SELF JOIN
- UNION and UNION ALL operations
- SubQueries
- Finding Nth highest salary
- Stored Procedures (with and without parameters)
- VIEWS
- Transaction Control Language (TCL)

## Key Features

### SQL Joins Covered
- **INNER JOIN**: Common elements between tables
- **LEFT JOIN**: All left table elements + common elements
- **RIGHT JOIN**: All right table elements + common elements
- **FULL JOIN**: All elements from both tables
- **CROSS JOIN**: Cartesian product of tables
- **SELF JOIN**: Table joined with itself

### Advanced Concepts
- **Stored Procedures**: Reusable SQL code blocks
- **Views**: Virtual tables for data abstraction
- **SubQueries**: Nested queries for complex operations
- **Transaction Control**: COMMIT and ROLLBACK operations

### Practical Examples
Each section includes:
- Real-world scenarios
- Step-by-step explanations
- Working code examples
- Best practices and recommendations
